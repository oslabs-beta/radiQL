/**
 * Welcome to puppeteer! This library from Google is fast-emerging as the gold
 * standard for end-to-end browser testing.
 *
 * One of the challenges of real-time testing is that almost every single
 * action is asynchronous. Hence, puppeteer is almost always used in an
 * async/await syntax. If you aren't familiar with async/await, in short it
 * lets you "pause" a function on any Promise. While it's paused, the JS engine
 * can continue to run synchronously outside of the function (just like a
 * normal Promise or callback). Once the Promise resolves, it comes back in
 * through the event queue and the 'awaited' function can resume execution.
 *
 * For a more in-depth look at the underlying design of async/await, see
 * https://ponyfoo.com/articles/understanding-javascript-async-await
